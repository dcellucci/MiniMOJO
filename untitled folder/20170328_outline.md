_Daniel Cellucci, Benjamin Jenett, Kenneth Cheung_

## Introduction
## Background
## Methodology
 * Robot Mechanical Design
     - <<Figure Showing Mechanical Layout of MOJO>>
 * Robot Electrical Design
     - <<Figure Showing Electrical Layout of MOJO>>
     - Main MCU ATSAMR21
         + Communicates between computer (bridge) and robot (coordinator)
     - Servo Controllers ATSAMD11D
         + Control servos using 3 PWM channels connected to a timer
         + Communicate with sensors uing I2C bus
     - Sensors
         + Battery SoC sensor
         + 3 channel shunt voltage current sensor
             * measures the voltage drop across a resistor
     - Servos
         + 5 Hitec-5035 digital hobby servos
             * mass, max torque
         + 2 for each half, 1 for the hip that connects the top and bottom halves
     - Power Systems
         + Battery for each half
         + step-up converter TPS51033 converts between the battery voltage and a constant 4.8V level preferred by the sevos
 * Experiments Performed
     - Climbing Experiments
         + MOJO climbs and the servo controller MCUs record the instantaneous current draw at <<A RATE>> during the climb, with timestamps
     - Turning Experiments
     - Lattice Sensing
         + Different Materials
         + Material Mapping
